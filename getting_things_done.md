## Part 1 -- The Art of Getting Things Done

### Chapter 1 -- A New Practice for a New Reality

* Covers a lot of the "why" we need a system to manage our todos/lives/organization. I know I need a system, don't need to take notes on why.
* Describes the need to "deal effectively" by first identifying and capturing all the things that are "ringing your bell" so you can make decisions on moving on them.
* Main points of the system are introduced:
  * "If it's on your mind, your mind isn't clear. Anything you consider unfinished in any way must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind."
  * Must clarify the commitment and device what you have to do to make progress towards fulfilling it.
  * Must keep reminder of these commitments organized in a system that is reviewed regularly.
* Defining "Stuff": "Anything you have allowed into your psychological or physical world that doesn't belong where it is, but for which you haven't yet determined what, exactly, it means to you, with the desired outcome and the next action step."
  * Key to managing all of your stuff is managing your *actions*.
* GTD requires two basic components:
  1. Defining what "done" means (outcome).
  2. What "doing" looks like (action).
* Benefits on working from the ground up in a "Bottom-up" approach.
* Need to control commitments, projects and actions in two ways -- Horizontally and vertically.
  * Horizontal Control: Maintains coherence across all the activities in which you are involved.
  * Vertical Control: Manages thinking, development, and coordination of individual topics and projects. "Focusing in on a single endeavor and fleshing out whatever is required for you to handle it, at least for the moment."
* **GTD really emphasizes getting every commitment and all "stuff" out of your head and into the system**. It is one of the core principles of GTD.
