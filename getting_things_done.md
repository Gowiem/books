# Getting Things Done - The art of stress-free productivity
by David Allen

## Part 1 -- The Art of Getting Things Done

### Chapter 1 -- A New Practice for a New Reality

* Covers a lot of the "why" we need a system to manage our todos/lives/organization. I know I need a system, don't need to take notes on why.
* Describes the need to "deal effectively" by first identifying and capturing all the things that are "ringing your bell" so you can make decisions on moving on them.
* Main points of the system are introduced:
  * "If it's on your mind, your mind isn't clear. Anything you consider unfinished in any way must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind."
  * Must clarify the commitment and device what you have to do to make progress towards fulfilling it.
  * Must keep reminder of these commitments organized in a system that is reviewed regularly.
* Defining "Stuff": "Anything you have allowed into your psychological or physical world that doesn't belong where it is, but for which you haven't yet determined what, exactly, it means to you, with the desired outcome and the next action step."
  * Key to managing all of your stuff is managing your *actions*.
* GTD requires two basic components:
  1. Defining what "done" means (outcome).
  2. What "doing" looks like (action).
* Benefits on working from the ground up in a "Bottom-up" approach.
* Need to control commitments, projects and actions in two ways -- Horizontally and vertically.
  * Horizontal Control: Maintains coherence across all the activities in which you are involved.
  * Vertical Control: Manages thinking, development, and coordination of individual topics and projects. "Focusing in on a single endeavor and fleshing out whatever is required for you to handle it, at least for the moment."
* **GTD really emphasizes getting every commitment and all "stuff" out of your head and into the system**. It is one of the core principles of GTD.

### Chapter 2 -- Getting Control of Your Life: The Five Steps of Mastering Workflow

* High Level Five Steps:
  1. **Capture** what has our attention.
  2. **Clarify** what each item means what to do about it.
  3. **Organize** the results.
  4. **Reflect** on the results.
  5. **Engage** with chosen items.

#### Capture

* Focuses on gather 100% of the "incompletes". Anything person or professional, big or little, of urgent or minor importance that you think ought to be different than it currently is and that you have any level of internal commitment to changing.
* As soon as you attach "should", "need to", or "ought to" to an item, it becomes an incomplete.
* Three requirements to make the capturing phase work:
  1. Every open loop must be in your capture system and out of your head.
  2. You must have a few capturing buckets as you can get by with.
  3. You must empty them regularly.
* "These collection tools should become part of your lifestyle."
* "Emptying the contents does not mean that you have to finish what's there; it just means that you have to device more specifically what it is and what should be done with it, and if it's still unfinished, organize it into your system.

#### Clarify

* Asking *What is it?* is important.
* *Is it Actionable?* Two answers: Yes or No.
  * If "No" then 3 possible outcomes:
    1. It's trash, no longer needed.
    2. No action is needed now, but something might need to be done later (incubate).
    3. The item is potentially useful info that might be needed for something later (reference).
  * If "Yes" then two things need to be determined:
    1. What "Project" or outcome have you committed to? and
    2. What's the next action required?
* Brings up the idea of a "Projects" list, which can be reviewed weekly to as a stake in the ground to remember finishing project.
* The next action goes into "Next Actions" list and is the key to thing to organize. This moves the project forward.
* Once the next action is decided then there are 3 options: **Do it**, **Delegate it**, or **Defer it**

#### Organize

* Outer ring of the workflow diagram covers the Organize phase.
* Need the following buckets: trash, incubation, reference, projects list, project material reference, calendar, list of reminders for next actions, and list of reminders for things you're waiting on.
* "Project": Any desired result that can be accomplished within a year that requires more than one action step.
  * You don't actually **do** a project; you can only do action stpes related to it. When enough of the action steps have been taken, some situation will have been created that matches your initial picture of the outcome closely enough that you can call it "done".
* 3 things go on your calendar:
  1. time-specific actions: fancy name for appointments
  2. day-specific actions: things you need to do sometime on a certain day, but not necessarily at a specific time.
  3. day-specific information: information that may be useful on a certain date.
* Calendar should be sacred territory. If you write something there, it must be done that day or not at all. The only rewrite should be changed appointments.
* Trash needs to be purged as it undermines reference and clarity of the environment.
* Incubation is the parking lot for items that would be impossible to move on at the present but that you don't want to forget about entirely. You'd like to be reminded about these items at regular intervals.
* *Tickler System*: Second type of things to incubate are those you don't want or need to be reminded of until some designated time in the future.

#### Reflect

* Review whatever lists, overviews, and orientation maps you need to, as often as you need to, to get their contents off your mind.
* Calendar is most reviewed.
* All Projects, Next Actions, Agendas, Waiting For, and Someday/Maybe lists should be reviewed once a week. This is the **Weekly Review**.
  * Gather and process al your stuff.
  * Review your system.
  * Update your lists.
  * Get clean, clear, current, and complete.

#### Engage

* How to choose what to do? At that moment there are four criteria you can apply, in this order: **Context**, **Time Available**, **Energy Available**, and **Priority**.
* **What action remaining of your options will give you the highest payoff?**
* In order to know what your priorities are, you have to know what your work is. There are 6 different perspectives from which to define that.
* Horizon analogy, "Looking out from a building, you will notice different things from different floors":
  * Horizon 5: Purpose and principles -- Big picture view. Why does your company exist? Why do you exist?
  * Horizon 4: Vision -- 3-5 years out. Bigger categories like career and lifestyle circumstances.
  * Horizon 3: Goals -- What you want to be experiencing in various areas of your life and work.
  * Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountabilities -- Key areas of your life and work within which you want to achieve results and maintain standards.
  * Horizon 1: Current Projects -- Relatively short-term outcomes you want to achieve.
  * Ground: Current actions -- Accumulated list of all the actions you need to take.

### Chapter 3 -- Getting Projects Creatively Under Way: The Five Phases of Project Planning

* Chapter hits on "Enhancing Vertical Focus", which is the mindset how to think productively on the individual projects.
* *Natural Planning Model*:
  1. Defining purpose and principles
    * The **why** question.
    * Knowing about the purpose is a prime directive of focus
    * The purpose defines success, motivates, clarifies focus, expands options, and creates decision-making criteria
    * Great way to think about principles is to complete this sentance: "I would give others totally free rain to do this as long as they..." As long as they what?
  2. Outcome visioning
    * This is the **what** instead of the why.
    * What will this project or situation really be like when it successfully appears in the world?
  3. Brainstorming
    * The **how** mechanism. Capturing things in an external way can give huge boost to productive output and thinking.
    * Give yourself permission to capture and express any idea, and then later on figure out how it fits in and what do with it.
    * Mind mapping is suggested as a way of brainstorming ideas. Core idea is presented in the center with associated ideas growing out in a somewhat free-form fashion around it. ![mind mapping](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cooltools_legacy/archives/mindmapping.web.jpg)
    * Basic principles of Brainstorming:
      * Don't judge, challenge, evaluate, or criticize.
      * Go for quantity, not quality.
      * Put analysis and organization in the background.
  4. Organizing
    * "Once you get all the ideas out of your head and in front of your eyes, you'll automatically notice natural relation"
    * Identify components and subcomponents, sequences of events, and/or priorities. What are the things that must occur to create the final result?
    * Key steps to organizing:
      * Identify the significant pieces
      * Sort by (one or more):
        * components
        * sequences
        * priorities
      * Detail to the required degree
  5. Identifying next actions
    * The basics:
      * Decide on next actions for each of the current "moving parts" of the project.
      * Decide on the next action in the planning process, if necessary.
    * "A project is sufficiently planned for implementation when every next-action step has been decided on every front that can actually be moved on without some other component having to be completed first."
    * "More to plan" can be a next action or the next step. This is a process action.
    * If the next action is not yours, you must nevertheless clarify whose it is (this is a primary use of the Waiting For action list)
