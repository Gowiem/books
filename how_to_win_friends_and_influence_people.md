## Part 1 - Chapter 1 — Fundamental Techniques in Handling People
Summary: Don't criticize, condemn, or complain about people because other than self satisfaction it accomplishes nothing and fosters resentment.
* Author uses a ton of examples from history/personal life to draw connections to his principles.
* “Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don’t criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be."
* "By criticizing, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment."
* Lincoln: “With malice toward none, with charity for all”
* Lincoln: “Don’t criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances”
* Work on self before trying change, regulate, or improve others. “Don’t complain about the snow on your neighbor’s roof when your own doorstep is unclean” - Confucius
* “But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving”
* “Instead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what they do. That’s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breed sympathy, tolerance and kindness. ‘To know all is to forgive all.’ As DR. Johnson said: ‘God himself, sir does not propose to judge man until the end of his days.’ Why should you and I?”

## Part 1 - Chapter 2 — The Big Secret of Dealing with People
Summary: Give sincere appreciation of folks strengths to help them and build them up as this fosters their "desire to be important". Avoid insincere flattery.
* “The deepest urge in human nature is the ‘the desire to be important’."
* “If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I’ll tell you what you are. That determines your character. That is the most significant thing about you.”
* “Many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality.”
* “The way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything I am heart in my approbation and lavish in my praise.” — Charles Schwab
* “In the long run, flattery will do you more harm than good. Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit month it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else.”
* “The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere.”
* “Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself.”
* “When we are not engaged in thinking about some definitive problem, we usually spend about 95 percent of our time thinking about ourselves. Now, if we stop thinking about ourselves for a while and begin to think of the other person’s good points, we won’t have to resort to flattery so cheap and false that it can be spotted almost before it is out of the mouth.”
* “Hurting people not only does not change them, it is never called for.”
* “I shall pass this way but once; any good therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.”
* “Let’s cease thinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let’s try to figure out the other person’s good points.

## Part 1 - Chapter 3 — “He Who Can Do This Has the Whole World with Him. He Who Cannot Walks a Lonely Way”
Summary: Getting others to desire to do the thing you want to do is the best way to get them to do something. Thinking from their perspective and point of view is an important aspect of that.
* “Necessary to bait the hook to suit the fish”
* Every act you have ever performed since the day you were born was performed because you wanted something.
* How can I make this person want to do it?
* Henry Ford: “If there is any one secret of success it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”
* Goes into the letters that people write where they talk about themselves and not the wants of the reader. Letters should first focus on what this person gains from this interaction and satisfying their needs.
* “If sales people can show us how their services or merchandise will help us solve our problems, they won’t need to sell us. We’ll buy”
* “When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves”
* “Arouse int eh other person an eager want"

Part 3 — How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking

Chapter 1 — You Can't Win an Argument
Summary: Arguing is a no sum game and should be avoided at all costs.
* "Why prove to man he is wrong? Is that going to make him like you? Why not let him save his face? He didn't ask for your opinion. He didn't want it. Why argue with him? Always avoid the acute angle."

Chapter 4 — A Drop of Honey
Summary: Remember to be friendly because angry or unfriendly vibes won’t improve any situation and is more likely to get the other person defensive.
* Will a hot temper and hostile tones make it easy for another to agree with you or like you?

Chapter 5 — The Secret of Socrates
Summary: Focus on preparing the other for a yes by asking questions that they have to agree to.
* Don't begin discussions with people on things that you differ, begin with that which you agree upon. Emphasize that you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose.
* Get the other person saying "yes, yes" at the outset. Keep your opponent, if possible, from saying "No".
* When you have said "No", all your pride of personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself.
* Socrates: his technique, called the "Socratic Method" was based upon getting a "yes, yes" response. He asked questions with which his opponent would have to agree. He kept on winning one admission after another until he had an armful of yeses. He kept on asking questions until finally, almost without realizing it, his opponents found themselves embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few minutes previously.
* Ask a gentle question.
* "He would treads softly goes far"

Chapter 6 -- The Safety Valve in Handling Complaints
Summary: Focuses on having the other person do the talking so they can work out their problems on their own or get their feeling of importance.
* Let other people talk themselves out. They know more about their business and problems than you do.
* If you disagree with them you may be tempted to interrupt. But don't. It is dangerous. Encourage them to express their ideas fully.
* "If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you." Why is that true? Because when our friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them, they -- or at least some of them -- will feel inferior and envious.
* "I ask them to share their joys with me, and I only mention my achievements when they ask."

* People may be totally wrong, but they don't think so.
* Try honestly to put yourself in the place of the other and understand their perspective.
* Think about things from others point of view and ask "why should he or she want to do it?"
* "I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person's office for two hours before an interview than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I was going to say and what that person --  from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives -- was likely to answer."
* An increased tendency to think from the perspective of the other as well as our own is a corner stone to much of human relations.

Chapter 9 -- What Everybody Wants
Summary: Practice sympathy for other person's ideas or desires.
* Magic phrase that will stop arguments: "I don't blame you at all for feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do."
