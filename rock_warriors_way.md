# The Rock Warrior's Way -- Mental Training for Climbers

## Preface

Summary: An introduction about how Arno Ilgner came to write the book and why it’s important
1. “What I found in my search for meaning was this: It’s our responsibility to create our life’s work in something we are passionate about because that is the most effective way we can create happiness in our life. A life’s work in “that something” is the best path to challenge us and it’s the most effective way to serve others.”
2. The warrior’s way is all about impeccable use of attention. Everything hinges upon how ones uses attention — does one waste it or focus it onto the task at hand? The principle was a very pragmatic and tangible guide.

## Introduction

Summary: Introduces the concept of the Warriors Philosophy, outlines some terminology, and sets up what the rest of the book will be on a chapter by chapter basis.
1. “Warrior philosophy derives form the uniquely demanding situation facing a soldier or combatant, such as a samurai, in a deadly duel. They must perform with absolute mastery and calm in the face of horrendous mortal danger.
2. Major tenet of the RWW is the resolution to be come increasingly aware.
3. Warrior Terminology:
    1. Attention: active form of awareness. Attention is awareness heightened and focused.
    2. Impeccability: Proper use of attention. Dictionary meaning is “flawlessness”.
    3. Power: Our ability to act effectively. "When acting impeccably, a warrior directs all of his attention toward his ultimate quest: to gain self-knowledge and personal power.”
4. How can we use the unavoidable truth of our mortality to empower us rather than cripple and terrify us?
5. RWW is in many wars a structure to guide risk-taking. Risk taking has three main phases: preparation, transition, and action.

## Chapter 1 — Becoming Conscious

Summary: Chapter focuses on developing awareness, limiting the Ego, and removing aspects of mental thought around climbing such as self-importance, reactive thinking, personal history, inner dialogue, self-limiting talk and wishing and hoping behavior.
1. Main task is to simple become aware of self-limiting thought processes that existing and explore the how and why of them.
2. Talks a good deal of the harmfulness of "the Ego”, a mental entity that rewards and punishes us with feelings of self-worth. The Ego lives by comparison and identifies with our personal history and the history of others.
3. To reclaim the energy that the Ego wastes, we must call upon the Higher Self, which isn’t competitive, defensive, or conniving. Higher Self derives self-worth not from comparison with others, but from internal focus that is based on valuing growth and learning.
4. People are all interdependent and each of us has a value which is not determined by comparison.
5. Achievement as a primary motivating factor is a self-limiting trap.
6. The Witness: Key step to Becoming Conscious is to focus attention. Focus attention on your inner self, on the flow of your own thoughts. Not important how thoughts come about or what they might mean. Rather when you stand back and watch them you can come to the understanding that they are not you. When you “stand back” like this you have located the Witness position. In this position you separate yourself from the complex goings-on within your conscious mind that affect your life and climbing performance. This provides objectivity necessary to analyze and change habitual or unconscious ways of being.
7. Self-worth: How valuable we feel.
8. Self-image: our sense of who we are and what we can do. This directly affects how we perform.
9. You absolutely must have an image of yourself as one who is capable of pulling it off. All the training the world will have minimal benefit to you if you don’t give yourself room to believe.
10. The expert expects to find a way to climb through the hard sections so he quickly homes in on that way. He expects to be able to rest, and he finds rest positions. We, on the other hand, home in on the difficulties, the obstacles, and the certainty that we will become exhausted. This image, not our lack of strength or technique, is our most limiting factor.
11. Your best climbs have given you something. It is growth. The experiences have helped teach you something about yourself. They have increased your self-knowledge and thus your personal power.
12. The ability to do things, the ability to learn, having energy to apply to new situations, self-confidence, boldness — all these are elements of something the warrior literature calls power.
13. We waste power through two means: Power sinks and Power leaks.
14. Power Sink: energy sapping elements of our personalities.
    1. Self-importance is the first power-sink. We sink attention in unconscious, ineffective, Ego-promoting thoughts. Petty comparisons with others.
    2. Second power sink involves self-image and personal history. The Ego goes to great pains to maintain the fiction of a constant unchangeable self. This is a manifestation of the Ego’s hunger for security. Identification with personal history creates this power sink.
15. Power Leaks: Another way to lose power is to fritter it away in effective mental habits, limiting self-talk, reactionary behavior, or hoping and wishing behavior.
    1. Ineffective mental habits: Things we do automatically with no conscious involvement. Habits that adversely effect climbing performance. For example: Placing too much gear on a trad climb.
    2. Inner dialogue: Voice inside your head that seems to accompany and advise you when you’re facing a challenge. For example: “I don’t trust my pro”
        1. A second form of limiting self-talk happens after the climb, such as after taking along time to lead a pitch, it may be accurate to say, “I climbed slowly”. It is a great leap, however, and not a logical one, to say, “I am a slow climber.” Don’t deal in absolutes.
